## Overview of the Analysis

Use spark sql to analyze home sales dataset and answer key questions:
* Average price for 4-bedroom homes sold each year
* Average price for 3-bedroom, 3-bath homes for each year built
* Average price for 3-bedroom, 3-bath, 2-floors, and greater than 2000 sq. ft. of living space for each year built
* Average price per View rating

Optimize queries by both caching the table and partitioning a parquet file
